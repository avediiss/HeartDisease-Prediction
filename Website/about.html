                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>1. <strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart
            diseases, with approximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life. Coronary fatty streaks can begin
            to form in adolescence. It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65
            and older. Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Sex:&nbsp;</strong>Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women. Once past
            menopause, it has been argued that a woman’s risk is similar to a man’s although more recent data from the
            WHO and UN disputes this. If a female has diabetes, she is more likely to develop heart disease than a male
            with diabetes.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Angina (Chest Pain):&nbsp;</strong>Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart
            muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen-rich blood. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The
            discomfort also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like
            indigestion.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Resting Blood Pressure:&nbsp;</strong>Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed
            your heart. High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or
            diabetes, increases your risk even more.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Serum Cholesterol:&nbsp;</strong>A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the
            “bad” cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat
            related to your diet, also ups your risk of a heart attack. However, a high level of high-density
            lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol) lowers your risk of a heart attack.</p>
        <p>6. <strong>Fasting Blood Sugar:&nbsp;</strong>Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas
            (insulin) or not responding to insulin properly causes your body’s blood sugar levels to rise, increasing
            your risk of a heart attack.</p>
        <p>7. <strong>Resting ECG:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;For people at low risk of cardiovascular disease, the USPSTF
            concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG equal
            or exceed the potential benefits. For people at intermediate to high risk, current evidence is insufficient
            to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening.</p>
        <p>8. <strong>Max heart rate achieved:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The increase in cardiovascular risk, associated with
            the acceleration of heart rate, was comparable to the increase in risk observed with high blood pressure. It
            has been shown that an increase in heart rate by 10 beats per minute was associated with an increase in the
            risk of cardiac death by at least 20%, and this increase in the risk is similar to the one observed with an
            increase in systolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg.</p>
        <p>9. <strong>Exercise-induced angina:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The pain or discomfort associated with angina usually
            feels tight, gripping or squeezing, and can vary from mild to severe. Angina is usually felt in the center
            of your chest but may spread to either or both of your shoulders, or your back, neck, jaw or arm. It can
            even be felt in your hands. o Types of Angina a. Stable Angina / Angina Pectoris b. Unstable Angina c.
            Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina d. Microvascular Angina.</p>
        <p>10. <strong>Peak exercise ST segment:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;A treadmill ECG stress test is considered abnormal
            when there is a horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm at 60–80 ms after the J point.
            Exercise ECGs with up-sloping ST-segment depressions are typically reported as an ‘equivocal’ test. In
            general, the occurrence of horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression at a lower workload (calculated
            in METs) or heart rate indicates a worse prognosis and higher likelihood of multi-vessel disease. The
            duration of ST-segment depression is also important, as prolonged recovery after peak stress is consistent
            with a positive treadmill ECG stress test. Another finding that is highly indicative of significant CAD is
            the occurrence of ST-segment elevation &gt; 1 mm (often suggesting transmural ischemia); these patients are
            frequently referred urgently for coronary angiography.</p>
